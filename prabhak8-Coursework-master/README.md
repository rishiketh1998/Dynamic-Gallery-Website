 <h1>Gallery</h1>
 <p>
  Build a website for up and coming artists/photographers:
Users can create accounts and upload photos of their artwork with info such as title and price. Users can also select a piece of artwork and click on a button which sends an email to the seller. The seller can remove items when sold.
Each user has their own homepage where their items appear. Any item where a user has expressed an interest should be flagged with the level of interest shown. Clicking on an item in the list should open a details page which includes a larger resolution image.
Users who are interested in a piece of artwork can make offers to the seller. Users can perform a global search for items of interest. The gallery should resize the item photo and add a watermark to the large one displayed on the details page.</p>
